# AI Usage Disclaimer

## About This Blog's Development

This entire blog has been "vibe-coded" -- built with a focus on functionality rather than perfect technical implementation.
I am a human who would rather spend time with family and friends, or reading about AI, InfoSec, science fiction, and playing video games, than focusing on a pixel perfect blog design.
I do however believe in being transparent about the tools and methods used in creating this platform.

## AI Enhancement Policy

**Content Creation**: While all ideas, topics, research directions, and core insights on this blog originate from my own searches, discoveries, and understanding, I do use Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the presentation and clarity of my content.

**My Approach**: I leverage AI tools purely for efficiency (and out of curiousity) to help articulate my thoughts more clearly, improve readability, and ensure comprehensive coverage of topics I've already researched and understood.

**What Remains Human**: 
- All research and discovery processes
- Topic selection and focus areas
- Core insights and analysis
- Personal experiences and professional perspectives
- Critical thinking and evaluation of information

**What AI Assists With**:
- Content structuring and organization
- Translation in languages I'm not fluent in
- Code formatting and documentation

## Transparency Commitment

I believe in being honest about the tools I use while maintaining the authenticity of my expertise and insights. AI can be an efficiency tool if utilized correctly.

The knowledge, analysis, and perspectives shared here remain fundamentally my own; AI simply helps me communicate them more effectively.
