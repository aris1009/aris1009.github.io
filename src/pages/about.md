# About This Blog

Welcome! My name's Aris and I am a professional Software Engineer. This blog serves as a platform to share insights, analysis, and practical advice about cybersecurity, technology, and AI.

## My Background

I have a diverse background in software development, with a focus on building secure and scalable enterprise systems. My experience spans various industries, including telecommunications, banking, gaming (the betting kind), and data analytics. I've worked with companies across the US and EU throughout my career. I've encountered my fair share of technologies, from legacy systems running on-premise to modern cloud architectures and microservices. More recently, I've been diving deep into information security and AI, with a special interest in agentic systems.

## Why This Blog Exists

I'll be brutally honest: every person using digital devices faces real security risks, from sophisticated state-sponsored attacks to everyday cybercriminals, scammers, and fraudsters. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex security concepts and practical protection strategies that anyone can implement. You can also expect guidance on leveraging technologies to improve your security posture. Some content will unavoidably be more technical, but I'll always label it as such.

## What You'll Find Here

**Threat Analysis**: Breaking down current cybersecurity incidents and explaining what they mean for regular users.

**Practical Security**: Step-by-step guides for improving your digital security posture without becoming an expert.

**Technology Insights**: Explanations of emerging technologies and how you can leverage them easily.

## My Approach

I believe security awareness should be:

- **Accessible**: Written in plain language without unnecessary jargon
- **Practical**: Focused on actionable advice you can implement today
- **Evidence-based**: Grounded in real threats and proven defensive strategies
- **Balanced**: Acknowledging both risks and realistic threat models

## Personal Note

I'm not someone who seeks hollow content generation to gain followers or views. In fact, I'm not interested in gaining followers or views at all. My motivation is to share knowledge, news, and insights I personally find valuable. Perhaps I can become a little voice in your head that makes you consider what it means when you share a photo of your child on social media, reuse a password, or unknowingly reveal your real-time location to unknown followers.
