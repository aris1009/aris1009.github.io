# Iteration 1: Initial implementation
- Created missing bundle files: article.js, media.js, prism-loader.js, shoelace-bundle.js
- Added ES6 exports to existing JS files (ReadingProgressBar, ImageOptimizer, Prism, addCopyButtonsToCodeBlocks)
- Installed @rollup/plugin-terser for minification
- Created build.config.js with 5 bundle configurations (core, article, media, prism, shoelace)
- All bundles build successfully with rollup -c build.config.js
- Ready for testing in production mode with minification
